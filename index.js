 * Fundamentals of Web Performance
 *
 * Thanks for joining the Fundamentals of Web Performance Workshop!
 *
 * My goal for this application is to make it a fully-documented example of a
 * *very* simple web application using basic tools and libraries.
 *
 * This is the main launcher, which just spins up the application on our running
 * port.
